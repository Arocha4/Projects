  This is a interactive user friendly dictionary program which prompts the user for a word to look up with conditionals
if the word doesnt exist or if the word was missspelled. This was done through a file I found online(data.jason) which
although is a json file contains a dictionarly like data structure (namely key and values). I imported the json library
to read the file and the rest of the file is commented for readability and ease of understanding. The user is prompted a
word to look up if it exists its returned the definition. If not there are a set of conditionals which suggests the word
meant whcih is a imported from a 3rd party library(difflib , sequence matcher) and the user is prompted again if that was
the word meant if not then the user is returned the word couldnt be could if the user did meant the suggested word then 
the user is returned the definition of the word.
